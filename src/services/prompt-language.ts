[Deliverable]

State the protagonist, inciting event, necessary action, and consequence of failure in one sentence.

## Core Conflict Chain
Connect the initial predicament, inciting disruption, primary goal, and opposing force.

Define how it is obtained, how it works, how it interacts with the world rules, how it progresses, and its cost or limit.

State the immediate visible threat and the deeper hidden truth or long-term mystery.

2. Keep the protagonist consistent with the supplied profile. Define their visible goal, deeper desire, distinctive appearance, characteristic use of the central advantage, vulnerability, and expected arc.

[Serialization requirements]
1. Continue naturally from the previous ending without teleporting the scene or abruptly changing viewpoint.
2. Drive the scene through action, expression, sensory detail, and dialogue rather than detached summary.
3. Use approximately {{word_number}} words to complete this chapter's conflict without filler.
4. End on a concrete escalation, revelation, or interruption that creates forward pressure.
5. Follow the project-wide guidance: {{global_guidance}}

- Story architecture: {{architecture}}
- Author-confirmed novel configuration: {{novel_config}}

[Output contract]
- Cover only the chapter brief and stop once its conflict is complete. Do not advance later blueprints.
- Output plain manuscript prose only, without headings, Markdown, analysis, plans, or screenplay formatting.
- Separate every paragraph with one blank line and use quotation marks consistently for dialogue.
- If the target length cannot fit in one response, stop at a natural paragraph boundary without asking the user to continue.
- Keep character voices distinct and avoid generic paragraph summaries, destiny metaphors, or unrelated philosophical conclusions.`,
